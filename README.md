## Website Setup (for future lab members who might have to make some changes)

### HTML (Content)
All content is contained within `index.html`.  If you wish to update the copy, or to add new sections to the website, `index.html` is the file you want.

### CSS (Style)
If you want to make any stylistic changes, you're probably looking for `/mollerlab.github.io/css/style.css`.  

### Hosting
If, for some reason, this website is not going to be hosted in this repo in the future, make sure you update the `CNAME` file accordingly.  Currently, the website is hosted here through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  The domain, [activefantasysports.com](http://activefantasysports.com), is leased through GoDaddy.  Any changes to DNS records must be made through GoDaddy.  Consult Arlen Moller if you need access to the GoDaddy account..
